# Machine Learning Essential Concepts

**Model Calibration**

- A calibrated model produces calibrated probabilities which means a prediction of a class with confidence p is correct 100*p percent of the time.
 It is important to know which percentage of samples that model predicted to be positive (with p probability) are actually positive in the dataset. With a well calibrated model we expect that p of the samples that got a predicted probability of around p to be positive. Model calibration measures how well the model prediction is aligned with true distribution of the data. [More here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDY2fH1FitQ).

**Model Overfitting vs Underfitting**

 - Overfitting occurs when the model is too complex and fits the training data too closely. This leads to poor generalization.
Underfitting occurs when a machine learning model is too simple leading to low model accuracy and poor performance.
